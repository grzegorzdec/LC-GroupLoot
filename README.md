## LC GroupLoot for WoW Classic: Wrath of the Lich King
 

### An addon designed to streamline and support the loot distribution process for your raid team. Simplifies the loot council experience, by automatically handling rolls on preselected items and allowing the raid leader to distribute the loot manually at a later time.
 

### Key Features:
 - Raid Leader Control: The raid leader has the ability to create a custom list of items that will be automatically need-rolled by them, ensuring that they can collect the loot for distribution later.
 - Automated Need & Pass: Members of the raid team will automatically pass on items included in the raid leader's custom list, preventing accidental rolls or miscommunications.
 - Config Share: The addon supports easy sharing of the custom loot list among raid members, keeping everyone on the same page and ensuring that all players are aware of the loot distribution plan.
 - Manual Loot Distribution: LC GroupLoot leaves the items in the raid
